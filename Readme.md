My Scripts
==========

These are my daily scripts with a command wrapper to avoid naming conflict with system and 3rd-party commands. 

Only usable on a mac.

Very sluppy, maybe **ONLY** useful to me.

Usage
=====

1. clone to `/usr/local/bin/`
2. enter `my` on your command line for help
3. read scripts in `/usr/local/bin/myscripts` for individual script function.

ps. Some scripts have help messages.
