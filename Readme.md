My Scripts
==========

These are my daily scripts with a command wrapper to avoid naming conflict with system and 3rd-party commands. 

Only usable on a mac.

Very sluppy, maybe **ONLY** useful to me.

Usage
=====

1. clone to `/usr/local/bin/`
2. enter `my list` to see available commands 
3. enter `my info` to see all command description
4. enter `my info SOME_CMD` see individual command description

Misc
====

Fork me if you really decide to use it for your own.
